hydrophilik
===========

Hydrophilik is an open source project collecting various data about Chicago's water infrastructure.

The project is currently divided into two applications
1. hydrophilik is a server that provides information about the dataset and the group to users, and hosts the developer API.
It is being hosted at: http://www.hydrophilik.com
2. JavaCrons are a set of Cron jobs that scrape data from various sites in order to fill the database.

The project is currently running a Postgresql database on an Amazon RDS database.  Please e-mail me if you'd like direct access to this database.
